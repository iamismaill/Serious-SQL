### Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample subscriptions table below, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

 
````sql

select 
  s.customer_id ,p.plan_id,p.plan_name,s.start_date
  from 
  foodie_fi.subscriptions s
  inner join foodie_fi.plans p 
  on s.plan_id = p.plan_id
  where s.customer_id in (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8); 
 
 ````
