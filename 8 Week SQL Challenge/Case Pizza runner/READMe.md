## üìö Business Task

As a data analyst, I am presented with a case study to assist Danny in analyzing data for his  Pizza Runner store that specializes in Meatlovers and  Vegetarian Pizza. Danny has collected information over a few months of operation, but he requires my expertise in utilizing this data to drive growth for his business. Overall, my goal is to provide Pizza Runner with actionable insights to help them grow and succeed in the competitive pizza delivery market. 


## Business Task

Danny is expanding his new Pizza Empire and at the same time, he wants to Uberize it, so Pizza Runner was launched!
Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.
