**8 Week SQL Challenge**

In this repository contains Eight weeks of case studies in #8WeekSQL Challenge ,  I have applied my knowledge of the language to solve various data-related challenges. In each case, I have analyzed data sets, written queries, and derived insights to help drive business outcomes.

Thanks @DataWithDanny for the excellent SQL case studies! 👋🏻
