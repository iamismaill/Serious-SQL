**8 Week SQL Challenge**

This GitHub repository showcases my #8 Week SQL challenge, where I have utilized my proficiency in SQL to tackle diverse data-related problems ,the case studies in this repository represent a diverse range of challenges, from simple data manipulations to more advanced statistical analyses. In each instance, I have approached the problem systematically, breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. I have used a combination of SQL queries and functions to extract the information I need from the datasets and turn it into useful insights.

Through this challenge, I have honed my SQL skills and deepened my understanding of data analysis. I have learned how to use SQL to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in data sets, and how to draw insights that can help businesses make informed decisions. This repository is a testament to my growth as a data analyst and SQL practitioner, and I am excited to share my work with the world.
