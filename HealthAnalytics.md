**Health Analytics Mini Case Study** 


In this mini case study, it present an untidy dataset from health analytics and an urgent request from the general manager of the Analytics team. 
They require our assistance with their analysis of the "health.user_logs" dataset.

The dataset contains various health-related metrics- My task is to inspect the data and provide insights that answer the following business questions:

1. How many unique users exist in the logs dataset?
2. How many total measurements do we have per user on average?
3. What about the median number of measurements per user?
4. How many users have 3 or more measurements?
5. How many users have 1,000 or more measurements?
Looking at the logs data - what is the number and percentage of the active user base who:
6. Have logged blood glucose measurements?
7. Have at least 2 types of measurements?
8. Have all 3 measures - blood glucose, weight and blood pressure?
For users that have blood pressure measurements:
9	What is the median systolic/diastolic blood pressure values??


By cleaning and analyzing the data, I aim to provide meaningful insights that can inform decision-making and improve health outcomes.
